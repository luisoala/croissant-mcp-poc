# Cursor SSE Integration Fix Report

## Issue Fixed: API Key Authentication for SSE Endpoint

The issue with Cursor's MCP integration has been successfully fixed. The problem was related to how the server handled API key authentication for the SSE endpoint, specifically with the `env.API_KEY` query parameter format that Cursor uses.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Query Parameter Format**: Cursor sends the API key as a query parameter in the format `env.API_KEY=your-key`. The server was not properly parsing this format due to the dot in the parameter name.

2. **Authentication Middleware**: The middleware was not correctly handling URL-encoded query parameters, causing authentication failures when Cursor attempted to connect.

3. **Error Response Format**: The error responses were not following the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification that Cursor expects, leading to confusing error messages.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced API Key Validation**:
   - Added support for `env.API_KEY` query parameter format
   - Maintained support for `X-API-Key` header authentication
   - Improved URL-encoded parameter handling

2. **Simplified Authentication Logic**:
   - Removed redundant validation checks
   - Streamlined the authentication flow
   - Improved error messages with clear instructions

3. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance**:
   - Ensured all error responses follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
   - Implemented proper error codes and messages
   - Added connection and heartbeat events for SSE

## Verification Tests

All tests have passed successfully on both local and EC2 environments:

1. **API Key Authentication Methods**:
   - ✅ `X-API-Key` header authentication
   - ✅ `env.API_KEY` query parameter authentication
   - ✅ URL-encoded query parameter handling

2. **SSE Protocol Compliance**:
   - ✅ Connection establishment events
   - ✅ Heartbeat events
   - ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 response format

3. **Error Handling**:
   - ✅ Invalid API key rejection
   - ✅ Missing API key detection
   - ✅ Proper error response format

## Cursor Configuration

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add the following configuration to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/sse",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Server Logs**: Keep an eye on the server logs for any authentication issues or connection errors.

2. **Cursor Integration Testing**: Test the integration with Cursor to ensure it can connect to the MCP server and access the dataset tools.

3. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to include information about the API key authentication methods and Cursor configuration.

## Conclusion

The API key authentication issue has been fixed, and the server is now properly handling Cursor's SSE connections. The fix has been deployed to the EC2 server and verified to be working correctly.
