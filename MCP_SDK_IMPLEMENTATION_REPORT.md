# MCP SDK Implementation Report

## Implementation Status

The Croissant MCP Server has been successfully implemented using the official MCP SDK. The server is running and accessible via the SSE endpoint.

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Implemented server using the MCP SDK
- ✅ Created tool definitions for Croissant datasets
- ✅ Implemented tool handlers for dataset operations
- ✅ Server successfully binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- ✅ SSE endpoint is accessible and returns session IDs
- ✅ Modified list_tools handler to be synchronous
- ✅ Fixed handler registration in FastMCP server

### Testing Results

- **SSE Connection**: ✅ PASS
  - Successfully connects to SSE endpoint
  - Receives session ID in the response
  - Proper event formatting with event: and data: prefixes

- **Tools Endpoint**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - Server implementation is complete
  - Tools endpoint returns 202 Accepted status, indicating asynchronous processing
  - Need to verify tools can be called successfully in Cursor

## Next Steps

1. Test integration with Cursor using the mcp_cursor_sdk.json configuration
2. Deploy to EC2 for remote testing
3. Document deployment and usage instructions

## Implementation Details

The server is implemented using the FastMCP class from the MCP SDK, which provides a high-level interface for creating MCP-compliant servers. The implementation includes:

- Tool definitions for Croissant datasets (ImageNet, MNIST, CIFAR-10)
- Handlers for tool calls with proper error handling
- SSE transport for real-time communication
- Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 message formatting
- Synchronous list_tools implementation

## Key Changes Made

1. Modified the list_tools handler in mcp_server.py to be synchronous
2. Updated the FastMCP server's _setup_handlers method to properly register the list_tools handler
3. Changed the server binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for external access
4. Created comprehensive test scripts for verifying server functionality

## Known Issues

- Shell test scripts are getting interrupted, possibly due to connection handling
- Tools endpoint returns 202 Accepted status, indicating asynchronous processing
- Need to verify tools can be listed and called successfully in Cursor

## Configuration

The server is configured to:
- Run on port 8000
- Bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- Use SSE transport for real-time communication
- Expose tools for Croissant datasets

## Cursor Configuration

A Cursor configuration file (mcp_cursor_sdk.json) has been created for local testing:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "croissant-datasets",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "none"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration can be copied to ~/.cursor/mcp.json to enable Cursor integration.
