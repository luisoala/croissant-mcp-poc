# Cursor SSE Integration Fix

## Issue Fixed

The issue with Cursor's MCP integration has been successfully resolved. The problem was in how the server handled API key authentication for the SSE endpoint, specifically with the `env.API_KEY` query parameter format that Cursor uses.

## Root Cause

1. Cursor sends the API key as a query parameter in the format `env.API_KEY=your-key`
2. The server was not properly parsing this format due to the dot in the parameter name
3. The authentication middleware was not correctly handling URL-encoded query parameters

## Solution

I've implemented a comprehensive fix that:

1. Properly handles the `env.API_KEY` query parameter format
2. Supports URL-encoded parameters with dots
3. Maintains backward compatibility with `X-API-Key` header authentication
4. Returns proper JSON-RPC 2.0 error responses

## Verification

The fix has been deployed to the EC2 server and thoroughly tested:

- ✅ Successfully connects with `X-API-Key` header
- ✅ Successfully connects with `env.API_KEY` query parameter
- ✅ Properly rejects invalid API keys
- ✅ Returns correct JSON-RPC 2.0 responses

## Cursor Configuration

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add the following to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/sse",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this configuration, restart Cursor to connect to the MCP server.
