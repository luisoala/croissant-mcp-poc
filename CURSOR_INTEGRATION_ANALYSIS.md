# Cursor Integration Analysis

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the server logs and Cursor client logs, I've identified several issues affecting the MCP server integration with Cursor:

### 1. Redirect Issues
- The server redirects `/mcp` to `/mcp/` (307 Temporary Redirect)
- This redirect causes API key authentication issues as the key may not be properly passed through
- Log evidence: `GET /mcp HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect` followed by `Handling SSE connection to /mcp/ directly`

### 2. API Key Authentication Issues
- The server logs show: `WARNING: Allowing SSE connection without valid API key for testing to /mcp`
- This indicates the API key is not being properly extracted from the request
- Cursor is sending the API key, but our server isn't recognizing it correctly

### 3. SSE Connection Protocol Issues
- Cursor logs show JSON-RPC format validation errors:
  - Missing `"jsonrpc": "2.0"` field
  - Missing `"id"` field
  - Improper error object format
  - Using `"message"` key which is not part of the JSON-RPC spec
- Error in logs: `Invalid literal value, expected "2.0"` and `Required` for `id` field

### 4. ASGI Protocol Handling Issues
- Server error: `RuntimeError: Send channel has not been made available`
- This indicates improper handling of the ASGI protocol in our middleware

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Eliminate Redirects
- Mount the MCP app at both `/mcp` and `/mcp/` to avoid redirects
- This ensures that both paths work correctly for SSE connections
- Removed the RedirectMiddleware entirely

### 2. Improve API Key Authentication
- Enhanced the APIKeyMiddleware to check for API keys in:
  - HTTP headers (`X-API-Key`)
  - Query parameters (`api_key`)
  - Request body (`env.API_KEY`)
- Added detailed logging for API key validation

### 3. Ensure Proper JSON-RPC Format
- The MCP app must send responses in the correct JSON-RPC 2.0 format:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-id",
  "result": { ... }
}
```
- Or for errors:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-id",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

### 4. Fix ASGI Protocol Handling
- Simplified the middleware architecture to avoid ASGI protocol issues
- Removed custom handling of SSE connections and rely on FastMCP's implementation

## Testing Methodology

1. Local testing with curl:
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: croissant-mcp-demo-key" -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

2. Verify proper JSON-RPC format in responses:
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: croissant-mcp-demo-key" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"search_datasets","params":{"query":"image"}}' \
  http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

3. Test with Cursor configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://server-address:8000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated server to EC2
2. Verify that Cursor can successfully connect to the MCP server
3. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
4. Update documentation with the latest configuration instructions
