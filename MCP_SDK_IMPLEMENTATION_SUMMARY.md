# MCP SDK Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a Croissant MCP server using the official MCP SDK. The server exposes Croissant datasets as tools that can be used by Cursor and other MCP-compatible clients.

## Implementation Details

### Server Configuration

The server is implemented using the MCP SDK's FastMCP class with the following configuration:

```python
mcp_server = FastMCP(
    server_name="Croissant MCP Server",
    server_version="0.1.0",
    server=server,
    port=8000,
    host="127.0.0.1"  # Explicitly bind to localhost
)
```

### Tools Implementation

The server exposes the following tools:

1. `get_imagenet_dataset`: Get information about the ImageNet dataset
2. `get_mnist_dataset`: Get information about the MNIST dataset
3. `get_cifar10_dataset`: Get information about the CIFAR-10 dataset
4. `search_datasets`: Search for datasets by name, description, or tags

### Async Implementation

The server uses async handlers for all MCP protocol methods:

```python
@server.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> List[types.Tool]:
    """List available Croissant dataset tools."""
    logger.info("Listing tools synchronously")
    return [get_imagenet_tool, get_mnist_tool, get_cifar10_tool, search_tool]

@server.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[types.TextContent]:
    """Handle tool calls for Croissant datasets."""
    # Implementation details...
```

## Testing Results

### SSE Connection Test

- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Details**:
  - Successfully connects to SSE endpoint
  - Receives session ID in the response
  - Proper event formatting with event: and data: prefixes

### Tools Listing Test

- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Details**:
  - Server returns 202 Accepted status
  - Never completes the request, times out after 10 seconds
  - Cursor would show "No tools available"

### Tool Calling Test

- **Status**: ⚠️ NOT TESTED
- **Details**:
  - Could not test tool calling due to tools listing failure

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. 202 Accepted Response for tools/list

**Issue**: The server returns a 202 Accepted status for the tools/list endpoint, indicating asynchronous processing, but never completes the request.

**Root Cause**: The FastMCP server's list_tools handler is not properly handling the async response.

**Solution**: Modify the FastMCP server's _setup_handlers method to use a lambda function that immediately returns the list of tools:

```python
self._mcp_server.list_tools()(lambda: self.list_tools())
```

### 2. Multiple Server Instances

**Issue**: Multiple FastMCP server instances were running simultaneously, potentially causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Use pkill to ensure only one server instance is running at a time:

```bash
pkill -f "python main_fastmcp" || true
```

## Next Steps

1. Create a modified test script that properly handles the 202 Accepted response
2. Ensure only one server instance is running at a time
3. Verify that tools are properly exposed via the SSE endpoint
4. Test with Cursor to confirm tools are listed correctly

## Cursor Integration

Based on the current implementation, the Croissant MCP Server should integrate with Cursor using the following configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "croissant-datasets",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "none"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Conclusion

The Croissant MCP Server implementation using the MCP SDK is partially working. The SSE connection is successful, but the tools/list endpoint needs to be fixed to properly handle async responses. Once this issue is resolved, the server should integrate seamlessly with Cursor.
