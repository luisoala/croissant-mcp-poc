# Cursor Integration Fix Report

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the server logs and Cursor client logs, I've identified several issues affecting the MCP server integration with Cursor:

### 1. Redirect Issues
- The server redirects `/mcp` to `/mcp/` (307 Temporary Redirect)
- This redirect causes API key authentication issues as the key may not be properly passed through
- Log evidence: `GET /mcp HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect` followed by `Handling SSE connection to /mcp/ directly`

### 2. API Key Authentication Issues
- The server logs show: `WARNING: Allowing SSE connection without valid API key for testing to /mcp`
- This indicates the API key is not being properly extracted from the request
- Cursor is sending the API key, but our server isn't recognizing it correctly

### 3. SSE Connection Protocol Issues
- Cursor logs show JSON-RPC format validation errors:
  - Missing `"jsonrpc": "2.0"` field
  - Missing `"id"` field
  - Improper error object format
  - Using `"message"` key which is not part of the JSON-RPC spec
- Error in logs: `Invalid literal value, expected "2.0"` and `Required` for `id` field

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Eliminate Redirects
- Mount the MCP app at both `/mcp` and `/mcp/` to avoid redirects
- This ensures that both paths work correctly for SSE connections
- Removed the RedirectMiddleware entirely

### 2. Improve API Key Authentication
- Enhanced the APIKeyMiddleware to check for API keys in:
  - HTTP headers (`X-API-Key`)
  - Query parameters (`api_key`)
  - Request body (`env.API_KEY`)
- Added detailed logging for API key validation

### 3. Ensure Proper JSON-RPC Format
- Implemented custom JSON-RPC classes to ensure correct format:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-id",
  "result": { ... }
}
```
- Or for errors:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-id",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

## Files Changed

1. Created `src/server_cursor_fixed_v2.py` - New server implementation with:
   - Custom JSON-RPC classes
   - Proper SSE connection handling
   - Enhanced API key authentication
   - Mounting MCP app at both `/mcp` and `/mcp/` to avoid redirects

2. Created `main_cursor_fixed_v2.py` - New main entry point that uses the fixed server

3. Updated `croissant-mcp-deploy.sh` - Deployment script now uses the fixed server implementation

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fix to your EC2 instance:

1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
```bash
ssh ubuntu@44.242.230.242
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd croissant-mcp-poc
```

3. Pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull
```

4. Run the updated deployment script:
```bash
cd croissant-mcp-integration
./croissant-mcp-deploy.sh
```

5. Restart the MCP server service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart croissant-mcp
```

6. Check the server logs to verify the fix:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u croissant-mcp -f
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Test the server with curl:
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: croissant-mcp-demo-key" http://localhost:8000/info
```

2. Test SSE connection:
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: croissant-mcp-demo-key" -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse
```

3. Update your Cursor configuration to use the fixed server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

After deploying the fix, you should see:

1. No more redirects from `/mcp` to `/mcp/`
2. No more warnings about "Allowing SSE connection without valid API key"
3. Proper JSON-RPC format in SSE responses
4. Cursor should be able to connect to the MCP server successfully

## Local Testing Results

The fix has been tested locally and successfully resolves the issues:

- SSE connections are properly handled
- API key authentication works correctly
- JSON-RPC responses are properly formatted
- No more redirects from `/mcp` to `/mcp/`

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fix to your EC2 instance
2. Verify that Cursor can successfully connect to the MCP server
3. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
4. Update documentation with the latest configuration instructions
