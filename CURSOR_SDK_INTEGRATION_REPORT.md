# Cursor SDK Integration Report

## Integration Status

The Croissant MCP Server has been tested with a Cursor-like client simulation. The results show partial success with the integration.

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Implemented server using the MCP SDK
- ✅ Created Cursor configuration file (mcp_cursor_sdk.json)
- ✅ Copied configuration to Cursor directory (~/.cursor/mcp.json)
- ✅ SSE endpoint is accessible and returns session IDs
- ❌ Tools listing times out with 202 Accepted status

### Testing Results

- **SSE Connection**: ✅ PASS
  - Successfully connects to SSE endpoint
  - Receives session ID in the response
  - Proper event formatting with event: and data: prefixes

- **Tools Listing**: ❌ FAIL
  - Server returns 202 Accepted status
  - Never completes the request, times out after 10 seconds
  - Cursor would show "No tools available"

- **Tool Calling**: ❌ NOT TESTED
  - Could not test tool calling since tools listing failed

## Integration Issues

The main issue preventing successful Cursor integration is the tools/list endpoint. The server returns a 202 Accepted status but never completes the request. This is likely due to:

1. Asynchronous handler not properly resolving
2. Potential issue with the FastMCP server implementation
3. Incorrect tool registration in the MCP SDK server

## Next Steps

1. Fix the tools/list endpoint to properly return tools
2. Modify the server implementation to handle asynchronous requests correctly
3. Deploy to EC2 for remote testing
4. Test with actual Cursor client if possible

## Cursor Configuration

The Cursor configuration file has been created and copied to the Cursor directory:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "croissant-datasets",
      "url": "http://localhost:8001/sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "none"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Server Implementation

The server is implemented using the FastMCP class from the MCP SDK, which provides a high-level interface for creating MCP-compliant servers. While the SSE endpoint works correctly, the tools/list endpoint has issues with asynchronous processing.

## Recommendations

1. Investigate the FastMCP server implementation to understand how tools/list requests are handled
2. Modify the list_tools handler to be fully synchronous
3. Consider implementing a custom server without the FastMCP abstraction if necessary
4. Test with longer timeouts to see if the request eventually completes
