# Cursor SSE Integration Fix

## Issue Fixed

The issue with Cursor's MCP integration has been resolved. The problem was a fundamental misunderstanding of how Cursor handles API keys in its MCP configuration.

## Root Cause

1. Our server was expecting Cursor to transmit the API key in either a header or query parameter
2. Cursor does NOT actually send the API key to the server at all - the `env` field in the configuration is only used internally by Cursor
3. According to the MCP specification, the SSE endpoint should be accessible without authentication at the transport level

## Solution

The server has been modified to:

1. Allow SSE connections without API key authentication
2. Maintain API key validation for other endpoints (/datasets, /search, etc.)
3. Provide better logging for SSE connections
4. Maintain compliance with the MCP protocol specification

## Verification

The fix has been tested:

- ✅ SSE endpoint can be accessed without an API key
- ✅ Other endpoints still require API key authentication
- ✅ Server correctly follows MCP protocol specification
- ✅ Cursor can connect to the server without 403 errors

## Cursor Configuration

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add the following to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/sse",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the API key in this configuration is not sent to the server but is used internally by Cursor.
