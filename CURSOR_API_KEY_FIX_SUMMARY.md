# Cursor SSE Integration API Key Fix

## Issue Fixed

The issue with Cursor's MCP integration has been resolved. The problem was in how the server handled API key authentication for the SSE endpoint, specifically with the `env.API_KEY` parameter format that Cursor uses.

## Root Cause

1. Cursor stores API keys in the `env` section of the configuration JSON
2. When making requests, Cursor sends the API key as a query parameter in the format `env.API_KEY=your-key` 
3. The server was not properly extracting and validating this format due to the dot in the parameter name
4. The JSON-RPC error responses were not properly handling null ID values

## Solution

The server has been modified to:

1. Properly handle the `env.API_KEY` query parameter format
2. Maintain support for standard `X-API-Key` header authentication
3. Provide better logging for debugging authentication issues
4. Fix type errors in JSON-RPC error responses
5. Use consistent JSON-RPC error responses for authentication failures

## Verification

The fix has been tested with:

- ✅ Successfully authenticates with `X-API-Key` header
- ✅ Successfully authenticates with `env.API_KEY` query parameter
- ✅ Properly rejects invalid API keys
- ✅ Maintains authentication for all protected endpoints
- ✅ Returns proper JSON-RPC error responses

## Cursor Configuration

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add the following to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "croissant-datasets": {
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "croissant-mcp-demo-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this configuration, restart Cursor to connect to the MCP server.
