# EC2 Deployment Report

## Deployment Status

The deployment of the Croissant MCP Server to EC2 was **unsuccessful** due to connectivity issues.

### Attempted Tasks

- ✅ Created deployment script (deploy_ec2_simple.sh)
- ✅ Made script executable
- ❌ Failed to connect to EC2 instance at 44.242.230.242
- ❌ Could not copy files to EC2
- ❌ Could not install dependencies on EC2
- ❌ Could not start server on EC2

### Connectivity Issues

When attempting to connect to the EC2 instance, the following error was encountered:

```
ssh: connect to host 44.242.230.242 port 22: Connection timed out
```

This indicates one of the following issues:
1. The EC2 instance is not running
2. The EC2 instance's security group does not allow SSH connections
3. There's a network issue preventing the connection
4. The SSH keys are not properly configured

### Local Testing Results

While EC2 deployment was unsuccessful, local testing of the MCP SDK server implementation showed:

- **SSE Connection**: ✅ PASS
  - Successfully connects to SSE endpoint
  - Receives session ID in the response
  - Proper event formatting with event: and data: prefixes

- **Tools Listing**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - Server returns 202 Accepted status
  - Never completes the request, times out after 10 seconds
  - Cursor would show "No tools available"

## Next Steps

Since we cannot deploy to EC2 due to connectivity issues, the following alternatives are recommended:

1. **Local Testing**: Continue testing the server locally and focus on fixing the tools/list endpoint issue
2. **Alternative Deployment**: Consider deploying to a different cloud provider or using a local tunnel service like ngrok
3. **EC2 Access**: Request proper access to the EC2 instance, including:
   - Running instance status
   - Security group configuration
   - SSH key pair

## Cursor Configuration for EC2

Despite the deployment failure, we've prepared the Cursor configuration file for EC2:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "croissant-datasets-ec2",
      "url": "http://44.242.230.242:8000/sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "none"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration can be used once the EC2 deployment issues are resolved.

## Deployment Script

The deployment script (deploy_ec2_simple.sh) is ready for use once the connectivity issues are resolved. It performs the following tasks:

1. Tests connection to EC2 instance
2. Creates remote directory
3. Copies necessary files
4. Installs dependencies
5. Starts the server
6. Tests the server connection
7. Creates Cursor configuration file

## Recommendations

1. Verify the EC2 instance is running and accessible
2. Check security group settings to ensure SSH (port 22) is allowed
3. Verify SSH key pair is correctly configured
4. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager as an alternative to SSH
5. Focus on fixing the tools/list endpoint issue locally before attempting deployment again
